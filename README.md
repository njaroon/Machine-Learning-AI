The purpose of this report if to check to see how Aroon Automotive is going. I've compiled information about our dealers, models, and profit. Our most popular models in sales have been the Hudson, Labrador, Salish, Beaufort, and Champion

Popularity and profitability can be different though. The Salish model is our most profitable model. It's accounts for 41.6% of profits. The Hudson, Labrador, and Beaufort models account for 16.9%, 16.8%, and 16.7% of profits respectively. The Champlain model accounts for the remainder 7.9% of profits.

The average profit by model also follows the same sequence with the Salish model leading in average profit by model. The average profit by model for Hudson, Labrador, and, and Beaufort models are about the same. The Champlain models represents the smallest profit by model.
